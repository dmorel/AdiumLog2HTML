NAME
    adium_logs_2_html.pl

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Parse Adium logfiles and turn them to HTML tables.

      adium_logs_2_html > adium_logfile.html

OPTIONS
    Options are passed on the command line, see an example below.

    "--account"
        The account, usually of the form
        "(Jabber|IRC|Twitter|GTalk|).user@service.tld".

    "--exclude"
        Regular expression used for excluding certain conversations (usually
        the other party's login name, or the chatroom name for a group
        chat).

    "--fromdate"
        Start date for selecting the logs to parse, in any format
        Date::Parse can understand. Optional, defaults to 8 days ago.

    "--todate"
        End date (inclusive), optional.

    "--user"
        User name for finding the base directory. Defaults to $USER.

    "--auser"

        sees at program startup.

    "--help"
        Print this documentation.

DESCRIPTION
    Transform Adium logfiles into a single HTML file, with 1 table per
    conversation, sorted by account and date, and prints it to STDOUT. Makes
    reading the logs possible (contrary to the built-in logfile viewer,
    IMHO).

    Here's an example:

        ./adium_logs_2_html.pl
            --account Jabber.+booking \
            --exclude 'conference|live' \
            --from '2011-07-01' \
            --user david \
            --auser 'David Morel'
                > ~/tmp/jabber_logs.html

    And an example of the full path to a logfile on my machine:

        /Users
         /david
          /Library
           /Application Support
            /Adium 2.0
             /Users
              /David Morel
               /Logs
                /Jabber.david.morel@jabber.booking.com
                 /john.doe@jabber.booking.com
                  /john.doe@jabber.booking.com (2011-03-29T14.40.23+0200).chatlog
                   /john.doe@jabber.booking.com (2011-03-29T14.40.23+0200).xml
